Hi Zoe,


Did not find the charger. Please re-check that I did not forget it at MBL, my office or yours.
I will give you one of mine meanwhile.
Instructions of what we talked today come next.
I highlight in blue button names or things you need to type
This is longer to explain than to do, you will get the hang of it very fast
And if you get stuck I can help remotely or come to you


INSTRUCTIONS
-----------------------

modify code as you wish in editor VScode (desktop shortcut called "code optode core")
at the laptop's screen left side vertical bar, press the icon
shaped like a rhombus, probably the last one
it will open a tab "welcome to particle workbench"
press the "local compile" button once done
check the message that says COMPILED SUCCESSFULLY
this will create a file optode_ble_top.bin that we will flash later


remove black board from optode
connect via USB
go to the terminal (desktop shortcut called "flash optode core") and type
particle identify
     (annotate device id number == dev_id)


do the LED sequence buttons so they flash yellow
go to the terminal again (same window works fine) and type
cd \users\kaz\git\optode_ble_top\target\3.3.0\argon
cd means "change directory" you only need to do this once


particle flash --local dev_id optode_ble_top.bin
  (replace dev_id with the one obtained in first instruction)


You don't need to particle identify every time, just when you change black board
If you keep this terminal window open, after every code change
you only need to compile and flash


Put the black board back in the optode
Maybe this procedure also works withouth removing the black board, I don't know, feel free to try
Board #4 seems to work, its ID is e00fce6884954b8fd6481090 but use it as last resource
