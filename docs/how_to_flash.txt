open "vscode" application
ensure you have a working internet connection

at the laptop's screen side vertical bar, press the icon
shaped like a rhombus, probably the last one
it will open a tab "welcome to particle workbench"


connect via USB a particle Argon device, 
better remove it from the big green board


press both buttons "mode" and "reset"
at the same time and keep them pressed
until the LED is static bright white


"mode" is the button just below the connector with 2 small rows of pins
keep "mode" button pressed but release "reset" button
LED will start blinking purple (blue + red)
keep "mode" button pressed until LED blinks yellow
when so, release "mode" button


now you can flash the optode_core code using "local flash"
at the rightmost column under "development workflow / flash"
in the tab "welcome to particle workbench"


the relationship between brain and a pair of optodes is in
files "docs/macs_co_op.txt", "ble_central.cpp" and "inc.h"


it will show a "flashing" message, keep connected
until it stops blinking yellow and is back to white
