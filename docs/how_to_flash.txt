at the laptop's screen side vertical bar, press the icon
shaped like a rhombus, probably the last one
it will open a tab "welcome to particle workbench"


connect via USB a particle Argon board, 
press both buttons "mode" and "reset"
at the same time and keep them pressed
until the LED is static bright white


keep "mode" button pressed but release "reset" button
LED will start blinking purple (blue + red)
keep "mode" button pressed until LED blinks yellow
when so, release "mode" button


now you can flash the optode_core code using "local flash"
at the rightmost column under "development workflow / flash"
in the tab "welcome to particle workbench"


it will show a "flashing" message, keep connected
until it stops blinking yellow and is back to white
